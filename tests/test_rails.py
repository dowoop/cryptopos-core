# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The table's VALUES, not its shape.
#
# `TableShape` asserts that every rail carries the right keys with the right
# types, and every one of the numbers below could be wrong by one without it
# noticing -- which is exactly what mutation testing found: 48 separate edits
# to this table left the whole suite green.
#
# The columns are not equally serious, and they are pinned for different
# reasons:
#
#   native_decimals    the worst of them. Off by one is a 10x error in the
#                      amount invoiced, in a rail's own units, silently.
#   display_decimals   what the URI states and the customer's wallet reads.
#                      Off by one asks for the wrong number.
#   gate_confs         when a sale is called settled. Too low hands over goods
#                      before the chain has agreed.
#   chain_id           which network an EVM URI names. Wrong means a wallet
#                      offering to pay on a chain nobody is watching.
#   rate_cents         demo only, and still pinned: a demo rate that drifts
#                      makes every demo assertion about amounts drift with it.
#   sim_block_seconds  simulator pacing, the least serious, pinned because it
#                      costs one line to stop it moving by accident.
#
# A rail added without a row here fails `test_the_golden_table_covers_every_rail`.
