"""Rails — what the terminal knows about a chain, as one table.

Pure data and pure functions: unit math and URI text, no network and no
state. Every field here answers a question some surface asks, and they sit
side by side so a drift between them is a one-screen read rather than a
scavenger hunt.

Carried across from the tkinter terminal's `rails.py` unchanged, including
the maturity notes. A rail that says `works` and a rail that says `partial`
are making different promises to the operator, and dropping the distinction
on the way across would be the first overclaim of the port.

    works       real testnet reads AND a real payer
    partial     real testnet reads, but no in-app payer
    sim-always  no free public endpoint in ANY network mode

Two decimals per rail, and the pair is the point:

    display_decimals   what a human sees ("0.001953 BTC")
    native_decimals    what the chain counts (sats, wei, lamports, ...)

The invoiced amount is computed ONCE at display precision, then scaled to
native, so small amounts do not round to zero. That one native integer is
the single source of truth for the URI, the screen and the watcher.

``binding_category`` answers a narrower question than the neighboring prose:
does the rail bind money to one sale even when the host derives no address?
``unconditional-per-sale`` says yes; ``not-unconditional`` says no. A host can
strengthen the latter by deriving a fresh receiving address, but cannot infer
the former merely by looking for an xpub in its own configuration.

**It is a claim about an ADAPTER, not about a chain.** D33 is why: Solana Pay's
reference was a sound protocol mechanism the whole time, and the rail still
credited the wrong sale until the adapter decoded the transfer instruction
rather than a balance delta. A chain that *could* support a per-sale binding
has not made one. Two things must be true and both live in code: the rail gives
each sale an identity of its own (`catalog.REFERENCE_RAILS`, or a host-derived
address), and its observer attributes the amount to the thing carrying that
identity. A rail with no observer has neither, so it declares
``not-unconditional`` — and that matters because
`cryptopos.catalog.declared_binding_category` lends a built-in declaration to
any installed plugin that declares none, and `api.rails`, `tools/rails_probe`
and `tools/snapshot` all turn it into an operator-facing "per-sale".

**What is deliberately NOT here.** Which endpoint an operator configured, and
whether a rail is switched on. Those are host questions -- they change per
deployment, they are edited by someone with a login, and a library that owned
them would be a library fighting whatever it was embedded in. `testnet_url`
and `live_url` below are the *published public* endpoint for a rail, which is
a fact about the chain; an operator's override sits above this table, not in
it.

The endpoint ladders, the measured finality tables, the watchability
arithmetic and `chargeable_in_mode()` also stay out, for a plainer reason:
they read operator config and measured timing state, and none of them can be
confirmed without the host they came from.

**A note on the comments below.** They are carried over verbatim, and several
cite things outside this package -- `watchers.py`, `simulator.py`,
`pos_actions`, `harnesses/`, `CHARTER.md`, `rates.unpriced_assets()`, "the
vault". Those all name parts of the tkinter terminal this table came from.
They are kept because each one records WHY a number is what it is, and a
measured value with its provenance stripped off is just a magic number. Read
them as citations, not as imports.

	Solana devnet sale awarded points on Ootle, and the receipt said so
	(`1884e30`). That worked, and it left the merchant holding two assets for
	one transaction and reconciling across a bridge that does not exist yet.
	The call is to collapse that until interoperability is real: one asset
	in, one asset out.

	**THIS IS A RESTRICTION AND IT IS MEANT TO BE ONE.** With it in force,
	every rail this terminal can currently charge on stops offering points,
	and the Ootle rail that would offer them cannot be charged in a real mode
	because Tari is listed on no exchange feed. So loyalty is, today, offered
	on nothing. That is the honest consequence of the rule and not a defect in
	it: `rates.unpriced_assets()` is derived from measured feed tables rather
	than written down as a verdict, so the day two feeds list Tari, this rail
	becomes chargeable and loyalty starts working again with no code change.
	The inequality is encoded; the conclusion is not.

	Deliberately NOT a `merchant.json` switch. A switch would make it a thing
	an operator turns off on a busy afternoon, and the reason it exists is an
	asset-management property of the whole programme rather than a preference
