"""Rates — a rate is not a number.

It is a number, a source, and a time, and all three ride the sale. A rate
read from a feed and a rate read from a hardcoded table are both usable and
are not the same claim, so the source is named rather than implied.

Microcents (cents x 10^4, i.e. USD x 10^6) because integer cents build the
error into the unit before any feed disagrees about anything: an asset
quoted at $0.07745 is 7.745 cents, which in integer cents is 8 -- a 3.3%
error on a cheap asset, which is exactly where a terminal handling more of
them must be more precise, not less.

**Mainnet is priced under stricter rules than anything else, and the rules
are here rather than in a caller's head.** Three of them:

    no demo fallback        a hardcoded constant may price a demo. It may
                            never price real money. `DEMO_MICROCENTS` says
                            BTC is $64,000; on the day that is half the real
                            price, a merchant hands over goods at half price
                            and the terminal reports success.

    no lone feed            one endpoint answering is not corroboration. A
                            stale cache or a compromised host is indis-
                            tinguishable from a correct answer until a
                            second source agrees with it.

    no wide disagreement    feeds that disagree by more than
                            `MAX_FEED_SPREAD` mean at least one is wrong,
                            and nothing here can tell which. Refusing is the
                            only honest move.

All three raise `RateUnavailable` (or its subclass `FeedsDisagree`), so a
host that already catches `RateUnavailable` catches these too and needs no
change to stay safe.

Prices are parsed as `Decimal`, never `float`, and the honest reason is
narrower than "float is inaccurate". At today's magnitudes it is not: a price
of 64001.23456789 scaled to microcents is about 6.4e10, comfortably inside
the range float64 represents exactly, and the two agree. `Decimal` is here
because feeds publish DECIMAL STRINGS, `Decimal` is the type that holds one
exactly, and averaging several of them in binary floating point is where
drift would eventually appear. It removes the class of error rather than
fixing an observed wrong answer -- which is the right time to remove it.
