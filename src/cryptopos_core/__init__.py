"""cryptopos-core — installable payment rails that owe nothing to a framework.

The public surfaces separate mechanism from host policy:

    plugin   concrete network/asset identities and immutable rail values
    registry explicit built-in and installed entry-point discovery
    catalog  every built-in rail, including honest partial capability reports
    bitcoin  verified Bitcoin Testnet 4 observation and settlement
    evm      verified Sepolia and Amoy observation and settlement
    ootle    final, transaction-attributed Ootle vault deposits and settlement

    rates    quoting an asset in microcents, under stricter rules when the
             money is real; converting cents to exact native units
    addresses checksum-verifying a receiving address and binding it to the
             sale's network -- the last check before money moves
    rails    what the terminal knows about each chain, as one table of pure
             data, plus the integer unit math that reads it
    uri      a payment URI per scheme — the exact string the QR encodes
    qr       a payment URI as a module grid, ready to draw
    chain    reading the Ootle policy tier — the promise, the ceilings, a
             balance — without an account and without a fee
    errors   documented refusals at pricing, provider, and payment boundaries

What is NOT here is deliberate: persistence, scheduling, permissions, and the
sale's state machine. Those are where a host framework is genuinely better
than a library, and a POS that hid them inside a package would be fighting
whatever it was embedded in.

    >>> from cryptopos_core.registry import RailRegistry
    >>> registry = RailRegistry()
    >>> len(registry.register_builtins())
    12

The chain reader takes its configuration at construction, so it reads the
same chain from a till, a web backend, or a script with nothing under it:

    >>> from cryptopos_core.chain import OotleReader
    >>> reader = OotleReader(loyalty_component="component_abc...")
    >>> facts, reason = reader.promise()
