# WHAT CORE STILL DESCRIBES, AND WHAT IT NO LONGER DRIVES.
#
# Every rail left here is a `RequestRail`: this package knows the chain's
# decimals, its address family and its URI scheme, and can build a payment
# request -- and it cannot observe or settle, so it says so rather than
# pretending. The six drivable adapters that used to sit in this tuple moved out
# in 2.0 to `cryptopos-rail-bitcoin`, `-evm` and `-ootle`, discovered through the
# `cryptopos.rails` entry-point group like `cryptopos-rail-solana` always was.
#
# The split is along the line that was already there: DESCRIBING is core's job
# and DRIVING is a rail package's. A described-only rail such as `dash` or `zec`
# has no package to live in precisely because nobody has written its adapter,
# and deleting its description would remove a payment request a host can already
# render.
